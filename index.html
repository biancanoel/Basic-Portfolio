                <p> Hi there, friends! A little about myself... It took a while for me to realize that I was interested in anything STEM related. I had always shyed away because I assumed it would be too hard. 
                    It wasn't till my advanced math and stats courses at UC Davis while pursuing a BS in Managerial Economics that I realized I enjoyed solving hard, technical problems and considered switching
                    After working a few years at a SAAS start up, including as a product manager, I was exposed to developers and knew this was the challenge that would keep my engaged and continously learning.  
                <br> <br>
                    My main personal interests are outdoor activities and my dog. The best is outdoor activities that my dog can be part of, like hiking, tennis (she's a great ball fetcher), and going to the beach!
                    The end of the day ideally ends in a great food and wine with a small group of friends. But be warned,  I turn into a grumpy troll after 11 PM! The earlier I am in bed the better.
